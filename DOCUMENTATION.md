The project is structured & organized in such a way that it promotes maintainability and scalability by encapsulating functionality into modular components, making it easy to extend or modify specific aspects of the application without affecting the entire codebase. 

In the project structure:

- **app.py and app_temporary.py:** Main application files where the core functionality is implemented.

- **data:** Directory holding the input dataset (`data_daily.csv`), ensuring a centralized and organized location for data storage.

- **dataset:** Module for handling dataset-related functionalities. `timeseries_dataset.py` is the main module for creating time series datasets.

- **evaluation:** Module dedicated to model evaluation, with `errors.py` containing error metrics like Mean Absolute Error.

- **main.py:** Primary script orchestrating the application, possibly containing high-level functions or configuration.

- **models:** Module containing the implementation of different models like linear regression, LSTM, and MLP, ensuring a modular and extensible approach to modeling.

- **notebooks:** Directory with Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis (`Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb`), promoting a reproducible and collaborative approach to data exploration.

- **outputs:** Directory storing model outputs such as HTML files and images, facilitating easy access and sharing of results.

- **requirements.txt:** A file listing the dependencies required for the project, enabling easy environment setup.

- **trainers:** Module for training models, with `base_trainer.py` containing the core trainer class used for various models.

- **utils:** Module for utility functions, with `scaler.py` housing functions for data scaling, ensuring a clean separation of concerns.
